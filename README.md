# Challenge1_CodeRefactor_Accessibility

## Description

The goal of this project is to improve accessibility and search engine optimisation (SEO) by refactoring an existing codebase, with a focus on a marketing agency. The website is optimised for search engines and ensures usability for all users, including those who use assistive technology, by following accessibility guidelines.

### Specific Features

To improve readability and SEO, the code makes use of semantic HTML elements.
Code is clear and manageable because HTML components are logically constructed.
To improve accessibility, every image and icon element on the website has a descriptive "alt" property.
To preserve a distinct content hierarchy, heading characteristics are employed in a sequential order.
Clear understanding of the page content is provided by title components that are both concise and descriptive.

### User Story

“AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines”

### Acceptance Criteria

Semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code.
HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.
Image and icon elements contain accessible “alt” attributes.
Heading attributes fall in sequential order.
Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title.

## Motivation

This project's main goal was to improve the website's accessibility so that a wider audience could use it and find it more useful. Important web accessibility guidelines were applied throughout this refactoring, ensuring that the website complies with industry standards. This helps improve the website's search engine rankings in addition to helping users with disabilities.

## Challenges and Learnings

Making sure every image had the appropriate alt text and rearranging HTML elements to make logic were two of the project's biggest challenges which had to be overcome without compromising the visual appearance. 

## Future Enhancements

In the near future, the following additions and enhancements are anticipated:
Optimising responsive design to improve compatibility with mobile devices.
Additional accessibility improvements, such as screen reader testing and keyboard navigation. Constantly improving SEO according to changing search engine algorithms.
